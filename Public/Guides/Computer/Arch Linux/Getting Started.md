## Install Arch Linux
1. Download .iso from Arch website.
2. On mac/win, flash it using Ethcher.
3. Boot from the USB and run `archinstall` util.
4. **Settings**
	1. **Drives:** When setting up drives, I chose ext filesystem and say NO to making home & root separate partitions.
	2. **Internet**: Under network settings, be sure to select networkmanager or you won't have internet. 
5. Go ahead and run it, let it do its thing and install OS. Once finished, it will ask if you want to chroot into your new system, you don't have to. At that point, you can run `shutdown now`, then remove the USB installer, and see if your new environment boots on its own.
